# Hexchat MPV now playing script

Original script from [kuehnelth/xchat\_mpv\_np](https://github.com/kuehnelth/xchat_mpv_np).

Usage:
======

`/mpv` - Show information about currently open file in mpv

Setup:
======

`mpv_np.py` uses the mpv [JSON IPC Protocol](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#json-ipc).  
To enable it, add the following line to `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf` _input-ipc-server=~/.config/mpv/socket_

`mpv_np_win.py` works without any setup.
